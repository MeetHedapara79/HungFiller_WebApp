## Inspiration
As I stay in hostel I faced a problem of food quality in mess and I also noticed about the food wastage by the other peoples which led me to get an idea about creating this project.
## What it does ?
Reduce the food wastage and also helps NGO's.

## How we built it
We created this project using technologies like, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS as for frontend. And ExpressJS, NodeJS as backend with MongoDB as a database. We used GitHub as a version control system and postman as a service for building and using API's.


## What we learned
Up till now I have heard so many good things about Hackathons and that led me to participate in Hack This Fall 3.0. Thanks to Siddharth dayalwal sir this wonderful opportunity as given to the beginners. As this was our first hackathon, we learnt so many things like how to collaborate on a single project with each member having a different skillset. There were so many workshops related to the new learning and we also learned from each of them. We also learnt problem solving in a project as we run into so many problems and we also solved them wisely.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
<br>
For backend : 
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

### Getting started with the app :

1st way : 
    <br> -> step 1 : Fork the repo to your account.
    <br> -> step 2 : Use clone link to clone the project to your local environment.
    <br>       eg. git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    <br><br> -> step 3 : run " npm install " in your command line.
    <br> -> step 4 : run " cd frontend " in command line.
    <br>          and than run " npm install " to install all the dependencies for frontend.
    <br>    step 5 :  run "npm start" for both frontend and backend folder.
    <br>    Now you are good to go for contributing to the project.
    <br><br><br>
 2nd way : step 1 : you can directly download the zip file of the project and go into the project using vs code.
           step 2 : repeat steps from 1st way from step 3.


### Future scopes ðŸ”¥ :
-> creating android version and IOS version of the web app so it can be easily accessible to the users. <br>
-> Apply AI to predict the food requirement for the given day with the number of users.<br>
-> Apply blockchain for transaction so that the transaction can be more secure for day scholars and other users. <br>
-> Make UI/UX more better version.<br>
-> Apply ML to discard meals having more negative feedbacks and recommend new ones.<br>
-> Connect the app with real NGO's.<br>
